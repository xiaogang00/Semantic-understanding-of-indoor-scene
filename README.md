# Semantic-understanding-of-indoor-scene

#### Semantic understanding of indoor scene based on RGB-D

This is a research project in  ZJU Machine vision and navigation laboratory, Hangzhou . The research Assistant is **Assistant Prof. Xiaojin Gong **

The main idea for this project is :

- Employ the method of image segmentation to locate every items we interested in the indoor scene.
- Implement the classification algorithm using machine learning(such as SVM and neural network) to label all items.
- Implement the depth descriptor for depth image to describe the support relation of items in the door.
