This is a framework for **Semantic understanding of indoor scene based on RGB-D**

We achieved high labeling accuracy by 

* acombination of color (and depth) features using kernel descriptors and by combining MRF with segmentation tree.
* One key finding of our work, not a surprise, is the need to have and to use a large amount of data. 
* We showed that labeling accuracy increased with the size of training data. Linear SVM, efficiently utilizing possibly high dimensional data, may continue to work well despite its simplicity 


The main idea can see the paper we attached.
